Buttons become faded/unclickable during transitions, and animations are too slow (>100ms).\n\n## Root Causes\n- Fade animations were 300-600ms, causing noticeable delays\n- Race conditions in allowUserInput/stopUserInput synchronization\n- Template rendering race conditions\n- Orphaned {{/if}} tags causing parse errors\n- CSS transitions not optimized for instant feedback\n\n## Solution\nReduced all fade animations to <100ms, fixed race conditions, optimized CSS transitions, and removed invalid template tags.\n\n## Related Commits\n- 78088ad1 - Initial FOUC analysis and documentation\n- f093f62a - Complete FOUC fixes implementation\n\n## Files Changed\n- `mofacts/client/views/experiment/card.html` - Reduced fade times, removed orphaned tags\n- `mofacts/client/views/experiment/card.js` - Fixed race conditions in input handling\n- `mofacts/public/styles/classic.css` - Optimized CSS transitions\n- `mofacts/client/index.html` - Template optimization\n\n## Testing\nManual testing confirmed buttons are now immediately clickable and transitions are smooth without visible flicker.\nEOF\n)\")",
