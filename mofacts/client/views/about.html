            <ul class="dashed">
                <li><b>is</b> a system in development that helps students learn information such as facts or concepts.</li>
                <li><b>is</b> a browser-based web-application, with source code available <a href="https://github.com/memphis-iis/mofacts">here</a>.</li>
                <li><b>is</b> now available with multiple sample content modules.</li>
                <li><b>uses</b> a quantitative model of your performance to select an item to learn that will optimally balance the challenge relative to your current ability.</li>
                <li><b>tracks</b> both prior performance (i.e. past successes and failures) and memory factors, such as recency, frequency, spacing and forgetting.</li>
                <li><b>saves</b> all of your results to track your learning over multiple sessions.</li>
                <li><b>was designed</b> by Dr. Philip Pavlik, and many other important collaborators who have been his co-authors, listed <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Phil_Pavlik_Jr/publications">here</a>.</li>
                <li><b>was implemented</b> by a series of talented programmers, who are given credit <a href="http://optimallearning.org/mobile-fact-and-concept-training-system-mofacts-beta.html">here</a>.</li>
                <li><b>can be used</b> to run experiments for collecting controlled data, which is used to create and refine the quantitative model.</li>
                <li><b>exports</b> data to a convenient format for sharing or analysis <a href="https://datashop.memphis.edu/">here</a>.</li>
                <li><b>was developed</b> over multiple years with funding from the <a href="http://www.memphis.edu/iis/">IIS</a>, IES: DOED, NSF, and R. Zdrojkowski.</li>
                <li><b>is explained</b> in this <a href="/ITS2016final.pdf">paper</a> to be presented at the 2016 Intelligent Tutoring Systems Conference.</li>
