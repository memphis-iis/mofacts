/*  Provide site-specific configuration. We do this via Meteor settings: see
    http://docs.meteor.com/api/core.html#Meteor-settings

    We start with defaults suitable for testing, but production MoFaCTS servers
    MUST (I repeat MUST) supply a JSON file whose contents are assigned to the
    environment variable METEOR_SETTINGS. See our server-side deploy script,
    but the final command without error checking would look something like:

        $ export SETTINGS_FILE=$HOME/settings.json
        $ export METEOR_SETTINGS=$(cat $SETTINGS_FILE)
        $ sudo -E -u $EXEC_USER forever start bundle/main.js

    You may test a file like this on your workstation with the --settings command
    line option. Using our helper script, it would look something like:

        $ ./run_meteor --settings ./my_test_file.json
