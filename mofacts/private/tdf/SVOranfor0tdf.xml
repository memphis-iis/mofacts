You will use you computer for this experiment, first to load the program, then to practice for 68 sentences, then you will either complete the posttest after a 2 minute wait, or be chosen for 1 day or 3 day later posttest completion, at which time you will see 54 concluding sentence presentations. This study should take no longer than 60 minutes total to complete. <br><br>

             Task: You will see a sequence of 68 sentences on statistics. Some of the sentences will be just to read and some will require you to fill in the blank '__________' (if there are two blanks, it is the same word used twice, but only type it once). You must press ENTER to submit your answer. Try to guess or remember the answers for the blanks, and if you cannot guess, just press ENTER to read the correct answer. If you get a fill in the blank answer wrong, you will be given a review with the correct answer. You have 16 seconds when reading for study or review, and 12 seconds to begin typing the answers for fill-in-the-blank sentences. Please make sure this window is maximized before you begin.
            Hit ENTER after typing to submit your response.  ]]></unitinstructions>

		<turkemailsubject>Link for 3$ Bonus for Turk HIT</turkemailsubject>
		<turkemail><![CDATA[
Dear Amazon Turk Worker,
Recently you completed part 1 of a 2 part experiment called 'Memory for Statistics Experiment 3', which paid $2.00. Now we would appreciate it if you would please return do part 2. It is a bit less work than part 1, but we pay a $3.00 bonus for completion, since it is so important for us to get the part 2 data. This must be completed in the next 48 hours from when you get this email.
Please avoid typos in your Turk ID, since then we cannot identify you as a part 2 person and cannot pay your bonus. You know you have continued correctly if it says 'Thanks for continuing. You have 54 sentences remaining.'
Here is the link to finish: http://mofacts.optimallearning.org/experiment/svo
Thanks for your help,
Phil
