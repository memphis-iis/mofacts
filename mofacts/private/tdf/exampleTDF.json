This practice will work better we think if you have read the textbook first, so that you understand the overall organization. For each important sentence we remove keywords and the practice is to fill-in-the-blank for each sentence. Sometimes we substitute a paraphrase of the sentence to imporve it or provide variety. Sometimes there will be 1 or 2 syllables presented as a hint. Fill-in-the-blank quizzing has been proven to be an powerful aid to memory, and the system focuses on items you get wrong to make sure you learn all the items thouroughly. The system  pronounces keywords to help you memorize them if you turn that on in the main menu. The system also provides the progress button above to check how much practice you have done, and how well our AI system thinks you have learned the words. We hope you will be able to use this progress information to decide if you want to continue the practice after you have completed the required amount.<br>        <center><h3>Practice Tips Video</h3></center>        <br><center>        <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgRcASfdjIY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer;margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>  </center>        ",
