            <strong><u>Benefits:</u></strong>
            Some of the benefits that may be expected include improved
            exam performance and data that allows us to improve the
            system for future classes.
          </p>
          <p>
          <strong>	<u>Alternatives</u></strong>
            : If you do not want to take part in the study, as an
            alternative for each of the 3 chapters you will be able to
            submit a completed McGraw Hill study guide worksheet
            exercise that accompanies the textbook. Please see your
            instructor or syllabus for the details of the alternative.
            As a student if you decide not to take part in this study
            your choice will have no effect on your academic status or

  <h3>
    Who is conducting this research?
  </h3>
  <p>
      Philip Pavlik of the University of Memphis, Institute of Intelligent
      Systems and Department of Psychology is in charge of the study. There
      may be other research team members assisting during the study.

  </p>
  <h3>
    What happens if I agree to participate in this Research?
  </h3>
  <p>
    If you agree you will be asked to you will sign-in sometime during the
    coursework for each exam and spend 3 hours practicing for each of 3
    chapters of material. There are not different groups in this study, since
    we are in the process of improving the system before a comparison test.
    After the 3 hours of practice distributed with 1 hour on each of the 3
    chapters of material, there will be brief survey that shouldn't take longer
    than 30 minutes, this survey is voluntary and not required for the extra
    credit, but lets you give feedback on the system to help us improve it.
    Practice itself is a sequence of fill-in-the blank items created from your
    textbook to maximize their relevance to the chapter material. You fill in
    the correct words using a practice app on your smartphone or computer. The
    items repeat until you learn them completely, which we expect will help in
    the course exams.<a name="_Hlk1479746"></a>
  </p>
  <h3>
    What happens to the information collected for this research?
  </h3>
  <p>
    By participating, you understand and agree that the deidentified data
    gathered during this study may be used by the University of Memphis and
    published and/or disclosed by the University of Memphis to others outside

    information will ever be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination
    of the research data and/or results to other researchers. In fact, we will
    never receive any personally identifying information in the course of this
    study.
  </p>
  <h3>
    How will my privacy and data confidentiality be protected?
  </h3>
  <p>
    We are very careful to protect student's identity in the course of this
    research. Our data collection strategy is designed to never expose the true
    identity of students to our research team. Data-linkage will occur through
    a random login ID distributed to each student the first week of the course.
    Your instructors have been carefully informed that they should not share
    the identities of students with us, so we will only identify you with your
    assigned login. Only teachers will create the keys to match logins to
    individuals. We do not log GPS or IP address information. We will further
    deidentify your data (remove your ID) after the experiment before storing
    it on our password protected computers long-term.
  </p>
  <h3>
    What if I want to stop participating in this research?
  </h3>
  <p>
    It is up to you to decide whether you want to volunteer for this study. It
    is also ok to decide to end your participation at any time. There is no
    penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled if you
    decided to withdraw your participation. Your decision about participating
    will not affect your relationship with the researcher(s) or the University
    of Memphis or Southwest Tennessee Community College. You will receive
    partial credit for each hour of participation, i.e. 1% per hour.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Will it cost me money to take part in this research?
  </h3>
  <p>
    No. <strong></strong>
  </p>
  <h3>
    Will I receive any compensation or reward for participating in this
    research?
  </h3>
  <p>
    For the 1 hour of practice on each of 3 chapters (total 3 hours) you will
    get 3% extra credit in the course.
  </p>
  <h3>
    Who can answer my question about this research?
  </h3>
  <p>
    Before you decide to volunteer for this study, if you have questions,
    suggestions, concerns, or complaints about the study, you can contact the
  investigator, Dr. Philip Pavlik at 412-605-0581	or email <a name="_Hlk12372411">ppavlik@memphis.edu</a>. If you have
