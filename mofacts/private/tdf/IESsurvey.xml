            highlights key information for you to consider when deciding if you want to
            participate. More detailed information is provided below the box. Please
            ask the researcher(s) any questions about the study before you make your
            decision. If you volunteer, you will be one of about 150 people to do so.

                    <strong><u>Voluntary Consent: </u></strong>
                    You are being asked to volunteer for a research study. It
                    is up to you whether you choose to participate or not.
                    There will be no penalty or loss of benefit to which you
                    are otherwise entitled if you choose not to participate or
                    discontinue participation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong><u>Purpose:</u></strong>
                    The purpose of the study is to help us understand results
                    from an adaptive practice system for Anatomy and
                    Physiology. You are being invited to participate because
                    are a student in a participating section of Anatomy and
                    Physiology at Southwest Tennessee Community College.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong><u>Duration:</u></strong>
                    It is expected that your participation will last 30 minutes
                    or less.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong><u>Procedures and Activities</u></strong>
                    : You will be asked some demographic questions to get a
                    better idea of past experience of students. There will also
                    be a survey of author recognition to get an idea how much
                    reading you do in your spare time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong><u>Risk:</u></strong>
                    Some of the foreseeable risk or discomforts of your
                    participation include boredom or stress if you find the
                    author recognition difficult.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong><u>Benefits:</u></strong>
                    The benefit is in helping us improve the system for future
                    students. This may improve student learning and success.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong><u>Alternatives</u></strong>
                    : Participation is voluntary, and the only alternative is
                    to not participate. As a student if you decide not to take
                    part in this study your choice will have no effect on your
                    academic status or grade in your class.

            <h3>Who is conducting this research?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            Philip Pavlik of the University of Memphis, Institute of Intelligent
            Systems and Department of Psychology is in charge of the study. There may
            be other research team members assisting during the study.
          </p>
            <h3>What happens if I agree to participate in this Research?</h3>
          <p>
            If you agree you will be asked to answer 30 quick demographics questions
            and then try to identify authors from a list of 65 authors that will be
            presented.
          </p>
            <h3>
              What happens to the information collected for this research?
            </h3>
          <p>
            By participating, you understand and agree that the deidentified data
            gathered during this study may be used by the University of Memphis and
            published and/or disclosed by the University of Memphis to others outside
            of the University of Memphis. However, no personally identifying
            information will ever be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination
            of the research data and/or results to other researchers. In fact, we will
            never receive any personally identifying information in the course of this
            study.
          </p>
          <p>
            <h3>How will my privacy and data confidentiality be protected?</h3>
          </p>
          <p>
            We are very careful to protect student's identity in the course of this
            research. Our data collection strategy is designed to never expose the true
            identity of students to our research team. Data-linkage will occur through
            a random login ID distributed to each student the first week of the course.
            Your instructors have been carefully informed that they should not share
            the identities of students with us, so we will only identify you with your
            assigned login. Only teachers will create the keys to match logins to
            individuals. We do not log GPS or IP address information. We will further
            deidentify your data (remove your ID) after the experiment before storing
            it on our computers long-term..
          </p>
            <h3>What if I want to stop participating in this research?</h3>
          <p>
            It is up to you to decide whether you want to volunteer for this study. It
            is also ok to decide to end your participation at any time. There is no
            penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled if you
            decided to withdraw your participation. Your decision about participating
            will not affect your relationship with the researcher(s) or the University
          of Memphis or Southwest Tennessee Community College.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Will it cost me money to take part in this research?
          </h3>
          <p>
            No.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Will I receive any compensation or reward for participating in this
            research?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Your professor will distribute a $10 Macy's gift card if you complete this
            survey before the chapter 11 exam. Professors will distribute
            the gift cards to the students who completed the survey.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Who can answer my question about this research?
          </h3>
          <p>
        Before you decide to volunteer for this study, if you have questions, suggestions, concerns, or complaints about the
            study, you can contact the investigator, Dr. Philip Pavlik at 412-605-0581
