This must be completed in the next 48 hours from when you get this email.\nPlease avoid typos in your Turk ID, since then we cannot identify you as a part 2 person and cannot pay your bonus. You know you have continued correctly if it says 'Thanks for continuing. You have 54 sentences remaining.'\nHere is the link to finish: http://mofacts.optimallearning.org/experiment/svo\nThanks for your help,\nPhil\n        ",
