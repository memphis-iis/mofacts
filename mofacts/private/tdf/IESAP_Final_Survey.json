There are not different groups in this study, since\n    we are in the process of improving the system before a comparison test.\n    After the 3 hours of practice distributed with 1 hour on each of the 3\n    chapters of material, there will be brief survey that shouldn't take longer\n    than 30 minutes, this survey is voluntary and not required for the extra\n    credit, but lets you give feedback on the system to help us improve it.\n    Practice itself is a sequence of fill-in-the blank items created from your\n    textbook to maximize their relevance to the chapter material. You fill in\n    the correct words using a practice app on your smartphone or computer.
