occurs when we measure ourselves in comparison to others if something is difficult to measure objectively. \n<br><br>\nThe fundamental attribution error is the tendency we have to view internal causes, such as personality, as the reason for other people’s behaviors.\n<br><br>\nThe actor-observer bias refers to the tendency to assign external causes to our own behaviors and internal causes to other people’s behavior.\n<br><br>\nIf you wish to persuade an audience, only one side of the argument should be presented to a poorly informed audience. \n<br><br>\nCognitive dissonance occurs when contradicting or clashing thoughts cause discomfort.\n<br><br>\nA person is more likely to conform if he or she lives in a culture that emphasizes group cooperation.\n<br><br>\nThe process of spontaneously changing your behavior to match that of others is called conformity. \n<br><br>\nWhen using the door-in-the-face approach, you first ask for a larger favor than you actually want, in the hopes that the smaller favor you do want will seem more reasonable in comparison. \n<br><br>\nIf one person in a group begins to resist the orders of a legitimate authority, other people are more likely to disobey the authority as well.\n<br><br>\nThe chances that a bystander will give help in an emergency is reduced when there are others nearby who could also help.\n<br><br>\nStereotype threat refers to the risk people have to conform to a negative stereotype about a group they belong to. \n<br><br>\nGroup sanctions are threats of ridicule or rejection for nonconformity. \n<br><br>\nThe somatic nervous system is involved in controlling voluntary functions and movements of the body. \n<br><br>\nThe autonomic nervous system controls the involuntary physical changes that occur in the body, such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, and perspiration.\n<br><br>\nAxon terminals are bulb-shaped parts at the end of the part of the neuron that sends information to other neurons.\n<br><br>\nSmall gaps in the myelin result in nerve impulses jumping from gap to gap which causes the nerve impulses to move faster.\n<br><br>\nThe action potential is an all or nothing event within a single neuron that is primarily an electrical process. \n<br><br>\nNeuroplasticity refers to the fact that in response to experience, synaptic connections may grow stronger and new connections may form within the brain.\n<br><br>\nThe cerebral cortex is highest functioning and largest brain area in humans, and is important in differentiating intelligence between humans and other animals. \n<br><br>\nThe right hemisphere of the brain deals with information by exploring overall patterns and general connections.\n<br><br>\nIf a person suffers damage to their hippocampus, they will likely have difficulties forming new memories.\n<br><br>\nAlthough commonly thought to be true, it is a misconception that humans only use 10% of their brain.\n<br><br>\nA conceptual rule is a formal guideline for deciding whether objects or events belong to a category or class.\n<br><br>\nAn ideal model used as a prime example of a particular concept is a prototype. \n<br><br>\nThe connotative meaning is the emotional or personal meaning of a word.\n<br><br>\nThe linguistic relativity hypothesis says that the words we use not only reflect our thoughts but can also shape our thoughts.\n<br><br>\nThe entity theory of intelligence is the theory that intelligence is unchangeable or set in stone. \n<br><br>\nCognitive load refers to the amount of mental effort one uses on a task.\n<br><br>\nFunctional fixedness refers to the inability to see past conventions about uses or meanings.\n<br><br>\nExpert skills are based on learned heuristics and broad conceptual understanding.\n<br><br>\nThe tendency to select wrong answers because they seem to match pre-existing mental categories is referred to as the representativeness heuristic.\n<br><br>\nFraming refers to the fact that decision making can be influenced by the way that a problem is stated or structured. \n<br><br>\nPriming, framing and anchoring are all related to influencing how someone takes in, reads, and interprets new information.\n<br><br>\nThe anchoring heuristic or bias is when we rely too heavily on the first piece of information offered when making decisions.\n<br><br>\nSystem 1, or experiential processing, is considered part of cognition, handles concept categorization, is not constrained by working memory capacity, and is a rapid, automatic form of processing. \n<br><br>\nThe notion that language is invented, proliferates, and dies, suggests that language is a living organism.\n<br><br>\nThe ability of our minds to process information, such as text, automatically is best illustrated by the Stroop Task. \n<br><br>\nWhen creating impressions, inaccurate impressions are often formed when negation is used.\n<br><br>\nStimulus motives refer to the need for information, exploration,\nmanipulation, and sensory input. \n<br><br>\nMaslow’s basic needs were more likely to direct human activity until they were met.\n<br><br>\nExtrinsic motivation stems from obvious external rewards.\n<br><br>\nThe sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is also known as the fight-or-flight system.\n<br><br>\nBasic emotions, such as fear, are first processed in the sub cortex.\n<br><br>\nComplex emotions are often under the control of higher brain centers and are a form of reflective processing.\n<br><br>\nThe parasympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for calming and restoring the body and conserving energy.\n<br><br>\nAccording to the Cannon-Bard theory of emotion, we experience emotion and physiological arousal and responses simultaneously. \n<br><br>\nSchachter-Singer’s theory of emotion says that the specific emotion that an aroused person experiences depends on the cognitive factors present during physiological arousal.\n<br><br>\nSchachter-Singer’s cognitive theory states that we likely choose the appropriate label for the source of our arousal through a process called appraisal or labeling.\n<br><br>\nThe
